            <h1>How Our Guarantee Works</h1>
            <p>We understand how important measurable academic results are for parents, which is why we offer this Results Guarantee to provide you with peace of mind. Here's how we ensure your child stays on the path to success:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Personalized Learning Plans: Each student follows a custom learning plan based on their unique strengths and areas for improvement.</li>
                <li>Ongoing Assessments: We track your child's progress through both school-issued weighted assignments (WAs) and OPUS Tuition-issued topical tests to assess their improvement.</li>
                <li>Targeted Support: Our tutors provide the guidance your child needs to master their subjects, ensuring that every lesson builds on their skills.</li>
                <li>Proactive Monitoring: We consistently review your child's academic performance, offering feedback and additional support when needed.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Our Promise to You: Real Results or Your Money Back</h2>
            <h3>What You Can Expect:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>At least a 10-mark improvement in your child's academic results over a 12-month period.</li>
                <li>A personalized, supportive environment where students can thrive.</li>
                <li>Clear and regular communication about your child's progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your child doesn't meet this improvement benchmark, we will process a full refund for you—guaranteeing that your investment in their education is risk-free.</p>

            <h2>Terms and Conditions of the Results Guarantee</h2>
            <p>To qualify for the Results Guarantee, the following conditions must be met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homework Completion: Students must complete all assigned homework, with an allowance of up to 3 missed assignments per quarter or per 12 lessons.</li>
                <li>Full Program Commitment: Students must have completed 48 lessons (1 lesson per week) over the course of a year.</li>
                <li>Improvement Calculation: Results improvement will be assessed as a trend, calculated through the average marks of school-issued WAs and OPUS Tuition's topical tests. If, after one year, there is no overall increase of at least 10 marks, a full refund will be processed.</li>
                <li>Standard Terms and Conditions: All standard tuition terms apply.</li>
